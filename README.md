# Replique Project

This a new version of the replique project.

I preferred creating a new directory altogether, because the whole project is going to get rewritten. I need to change completely the scraper, maybe move beyond paintings as the main image source (we'll see for this, not yet decided). More fundamentally, we'll move the whole deep learning architectures to pytorch for simplicity.
